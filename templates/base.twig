          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            PixSalle is a new platform where students can freely showcase their work and express themselves through photography.
            This web application will allow them to be members, explore photos posted by other photographers and picture editors,
            view resources that they can use to improve their work and contribute to the knowledge sharing within the community through blogs.

          <h2>How did we start</h2>
          <p>
            The Student Council of La Salle saw that a lot of students are passionate about photography. They have posted their amazing photos
            on various social media accounts. To help the students develop their skills and inspire them to be professional photographers one day,
            the professors proposed to create a Photography web application. That's why we developed PixSalle.
